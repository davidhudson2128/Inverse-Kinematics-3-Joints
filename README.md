# Inverse-Kinematics-3-Joints

This project, built in the Unity game engine, implements inverse kinematics to calculate the joint angles needed to move the end effector of a kinematic chain to a target position. 

The code implements the Jacobian inverse technique to iteratively adjust the three joint angles to move the end effector towards the target position. The code can be found in Inverse-Kinematics-3-Joints/Assets/Scripts/IKController.cs 

A demonstration of the project is shown below.
